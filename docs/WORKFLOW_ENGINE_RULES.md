# OpsAi Workflow Engine Rules

**Canonical governance for all workflow work.**

This file is the entry point referenced by implementation specs. Full rules:

→ **[workflow-builder-rules.md](./workflow-builder-rules.md)**

Quick summary:

- OpsAi owns this product; external tools are **behavior reference only**
- Do not clone external UI/CSS/copy
- Preserve expression syntax: `{{input}}`, `{{steps.<nodeId>.field}}`, `{{items.field}}`
- Incremental changes + regression tests (`npm run test:workflows`, `npx tsc --noEmit`)
- Node contracts: `frontend/src/modules/workflows/nodeContract.ts`

## Schedule trigger semantics (frozen — Part 7/7B/7C)

Authoritative calculator: `backend/utils/scheduleRecurrence.js`. Preview API and production scheduler share it.

### Timezone

Precedence: rule `timezone` → schedule node `timezone` → workflow `settings.timezone` → `UTC`.

### Recurrence strategies

- **Cron-compatible** — seconds, minutes, hours, daily, weekly (every 1 week), monthly (every 1 month), custom cron.
- **Anchored** — every N days/weeks/months where N > 1. `recurrenceAnchor` is set on publish and preserved across restarts.

### Calendar intervals

Days, weeks, and months use timezone-aware calendar math (Luxon), not fixed millisecond durations.

### Edge cases

- **Day 31 monthly** — skip months that do not have that day.
- **Feb 29** — only in leap years.
- **Spring-forward** — nonexistent local time shifts forward to the next valid local instant (e.g. 02:30 → 03:30).
- **Fall-back** — one execution per intended local wall-clock occurrence; repeated UTC instants for the same local time dedupe.

### Downtime

Future-only: missed occurrences are not backfilled after restart or downtime.

### Idempotency

Key: `schedule:{workflowId}:{nodeId}:{ruleId}:{localOccurrenceKey}:{timezone}` where `localOccurrenceKey` is `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss` in the resolved timezone (local wall time, not UTC instant).

### Scheduler runtime

Anchored rules use bounded reconciliation (`MAX_SCHEDULER_WAKE_MS` = 24h): the scheduler never sleeps longer than 24h without recalculating; once within the bound, the timer uses the actual remaining delay. No multi-month `setTimeout`. `refreshAll()` re-registers from persisted definition; anchor and idempotency remain authoritative.
